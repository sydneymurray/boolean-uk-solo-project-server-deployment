@everyone Backend Deployment

- Create a new database in ElephantSQL for your live app

- If you have your frontend's localhost URL hard coded into your cors middleware, you need to add a variable in your .env file for FRONTEND_URL and replace the hard coded URL in the middleware with process.env.FRONTEND_URL

- Add a file called Procfile into the root of your project (where your package.json is), and place this inside:

release: npx prisma migrate deploy
web: npm run compile


- Commit and push those changes to GitHub

- Head over to https://dashboard.heroku.com/ and login

- Create a new app in the Heroku dashboard

- Give it a name and choose Europe as the region

- Set the "Deployment method" option to GitHub, click the Connect button and search for your backend's repository

- Enable "Automatic Deploys"

- Go to "Settings" in the Heroku dashboard and click Reveal Config Vars

- Add each of your environment variables there. You don't need a shadow database for this, just your database URL and your frontend URL (the keys must be the same as defined in your .env file). Since you don't have a frontend deployed yet, you can set the value to your frontend URL to * for now

- Your backend will automatically deploy every time you push to GitHub, but you can trigger a manual deploy at the bottom of the "Deploy" page
